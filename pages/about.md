# Research Background

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. I'm interested in understanding what processes and factors influence our memories. I specifically research how a certain chemical in our brain called acetylcholine contributes to changes in memory as we age. By understanding how different factors impact memory in the aging population, I aim to develop more tailored interventions to improve cognition.
