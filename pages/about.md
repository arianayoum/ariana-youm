# Research Background

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. I am co-supervised by Dr. Katherine Duncan and Dr. Melanie Cohn. I'm interested in understanding what processes and factors influence our memories of our past experiences. I specifically research how certain chemicals in our brain contribute to changes in memory as we age. By understanding how different factors impact memory in the aging population, I aim to develop more tailored interventions to improve cognition.
