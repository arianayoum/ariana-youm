# Education and Research Background

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. During my PhD I investigated what processes and factors influence our memories, and how this might change as we age. I specifically researched how a certain chemical in our brain called acetylcholine contributes to age-related changes in memory. By understanding how different factors impact memory in the aging population, I aimed to develop more tailored interventions to improve cognition.
